# Arduino-Music-Player
Inspired by Robson Couto's [song templates](https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs).

Applied circuitry principles and soldering skills to create a music player using an Arduino Uno device. Transcribed musical notes into the Arduino IDE through music and programming knowledge.
